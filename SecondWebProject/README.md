##### Title: 3Django_SimpleHTMLPage_CSS_Connectivity
It is about how to render bootstrap HTML page with Django Platform.

Please Refer this sub-repository "FirstWebProject" for connectivity.

We can render Bootstrap HTML pages also in Django platform.

I have attached only index.html file here which placed into templates folder. I have used bootstrap starter template so that we do not have to link all the files manually.
