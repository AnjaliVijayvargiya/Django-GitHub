##### Title: 18Django_RenderingForms_Widgets&itsAttrs_FormFieldVariousTypes_EntriesSaveInDatabase_ClassBasedView
Project is based on WebProject15. This differs by a Class based view implementation. The results is same as of WebProject15. This differs from back-end coding.

###### While implementating this project, I have learnt some things:
1. How to save templates in application itself. So, no need to define templates in settings.py
2. How CBV implementation is done by defining Model and Forms.
3. How we can define templateview.
4. How to call get and post method in CBV mode. 


###### In case, if form is not submitted and rendering the same entry page; then check following things:
1. First of all, fill all the fields.
2. Correct Email format; such as vijay@gmail.com
3. Check Time format; it should be like this- 09:00:20
4. Select at least one color
5. Select gender as well
6. Click on proceed checkbox button

if all the entries are in corrent format; then you will able to see the detail.html page.
